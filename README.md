Culinary Chronicle is a PERN stack recipe review website. It allows users to register and sign in to an account, view, comment, and review recipes. The front end is hosted on Netlify and the back end is hosted on Render.
Due to the nature of the free tier on Render, loading times when the website has been inactive for can be long. If loading takes longer than a minute, refreshing the page should ensure the server is up and running properly.
